<h1>Best shows according to Maureen!</h1>
<h2>Maureen's top 3 shows</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Jua Kali</h3>
<p>Show from <i>"Tanzania"</i>, I love watching this a lot especially with my mother. The language, the gist, the acting imitates the Tanzanian living situation. Whenever, I'm back in America this helps me remember my culture.</p>
<h3>Mpali</h3>
<p>I love this show from <i>"Zimbabwe</i>, it's a telenovela which incapsulates a man living a polygamus relationship (7wives). It shows the benefits of it and the cons of it, where women are forced to share the man and at times a man loves one wife more than the other and fails to cater to other wives.</h4>
<h3>Huba</h3>
<p>Show from <i>"Tanzania</i>, this show encapsulates the love life of different people where they fall out of love and are able to find their way back to each other. Sad enough one of the actresses passed away recently, and it has left a lot of us in shock.</p>
<h3>FaceTime</h3>
<p>This is such an unexpected turn around but I love it so much when I FaceTime witth my family. Technology has made it easy especially to us who are living miles away from our loved ones.</p>
